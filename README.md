# Project-Report 2021

Deep learning having its vast areas of success, as compared to the other methods, have started a new wave of neural network development in a very small amount of time. Concept of deep learning has been originated neural network, i.e a class of neural networks with deep structure for the effective training methods. As a powerful technology, deep learning has been widely used in areas such as handwriting digital recognition, dimension simplification, speech recognition, image comprehension, machine translation, protein structure prediction and emotion recognition. 

Face recognition is one another area with has been recently dominated by deep learning methods, because of its advantages in comparisons to conventional approaches and even the human perception.This has also inspired researchers and engineers to reproduce existing algorithms with unified implementations and compare the performance under fair settings i.e by using the same standard set of evaluation parameters such as dataset and certain tricks in order to ensure reproducibility of experiments.


In this report we are trying to experiment the self-attention model impact, when combined with Res-Net-34 CNN model for the face recognition using LFW dataset. We have first trained the model on pure Res-Net-34 and then we included self attention blocks into the Res-Net-34 and tried to compare the difference in the performance that we obtained
